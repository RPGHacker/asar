v1.60 (by RPG Hacker, with bug fixes from boldowa/6646)

New features:
- Asar now uses CMake, which should make it easier to build on different platforms and
  with different compilers.
- Added a proper manual in HTML format to Asar, rather than just having the xkas manual
  and a TXT file with all changes.

Bug fixes:
- Fixed various bugs in the DLL interface. It should now hopefully be possible to apply
  multiple patches in succession via the DLL interface without resorting to hacks.
- Completely rewrote test applications once again to make it a lot easier to test a bunch
  of ASM files and actually get some meaningful information out of it.
- Fixed the way ;@ works. This command was really meant for backwards-compatibility with xkas
  and is supposed to assemble everything following it, which it now does again. As a result of
  this change, any of the following are now valid Asar code:
	;@asar 1.60
	@asar 1.60
	asar 1.60
  When Asar finds an unknown command on a line starting with ;@ or @, it only throws a warning
  instead of an error. You can make use of this fact by using optional features from newer
  Asar versions and still have your patch assemble in old Asar versions, where those features
  are ignored (don't know how practicable and useful this really is, but in theory, it should
  be possible). And of course it can be used for patches that are compatible with both xkas and
  Asar, not that that's particularly useful anymore in this day and age.
- Changed format of existing command line arguments for consistency.

Hopefully comming soon TM:
- undef/import (zetaPrime)
- include directories (via command line or TXT file)
- set defines via command line or TXT file
- defined() function (like C's ifdef/ifndef)
- Asar DLL: possibility to compile ASM from memory buffer
- customizable warning settings, like Clang or MSVC
- Some kind of include guard ("pragma once")
- stackable namespaces
- readfile() function to read arbitrary size of bytes into a memory buffer



v1.50 (by RPG Hacker):

New features:
- Added support for structs. Credits go to p4plus2: https://github.com/p4plus2/asar
- Added API to Asar lib for getting information on all blocks of data written by Asar.
- Added API to Asar lib for getting the mapper currently used by Asar.
- Added support for ExLoROM and ExHiROM mappers.
  NOTE: Based entirely on conversion tables I got from Ladida; don't know if these conversions
  are actually correct.
  Some features may not work as intended when using those mappers (such as freedata, for example),
  but I can't verify this.
- Added pushtable and pulltable commands, which let you back-up or restore the current character
  table to the/from the stack.
- Added "ext\notepad-plus-plus\syntax-highlighting.xml". This file can be imported into Notepad++
  as a user-defined language to add syntax highlighting for Asar patches, featuring all commands
  currently supported by Asar. By default, this syntax highlighting is enabled on all files with
  an extension of .asm or .asr, but this can be customized via Notepad++.

Bug fixes:
- Lines starting with @ or ;@ that don't map to a recognized special command now only throw
  warnings at best and no errors.
- Rewrote code of tests a little to make them easier to execute and make them clean up their
  own mess.
- C# wrapper for Asar DLL was non-functional since it didn't specify a calling convention,
  making it always lead to an exception in some scenarios.

Notes:
- Just like the last version, this version of Asar was built in MSVC rather than g++, but this
  time I also updated the Asar DLL (which I had overlooked last time). I'm not sure if
  Windows applications are compatible with DLLs that were built by a different compiler, so
  if you're planning to use the DLL, this is something to watch out for. If you're planning
  to use a compiler other than MSVC, I recommend just rebuilding the DLL from source
  in whatever compiler you're using (or directly including the Asar library code in your
  project).



v1.40 (by RPG Hacker):

New features:
- readfile functions: readfile1(filename, offset), readfile2(filename, offset),
  readfile3(filename, offset), readfile4(filename, offset) -
  similiar to read1() etc. functions, except data is read from another file instead of from
  the ROM (note that offset is a PC offset, not a SNES offset). You can pass an optional
  third value which is returned if the read fails. These functions are primarily intended
  for reading bytes from another file and then doing math with them. For example: reading
  bytes from a Lunar Magic .pal file, converting them into a different format and then
  writing them to the ROM as a table that can directly be DMA'd to CGRAM without further
  conversions (all conversions happen at compile-time). As an additional bonus, all of those
  functions cache any file passed to them (up to 16 simultanous files), which means that
  multiple readfile() calls on the same file will keep the file open rather than repeatedly
  opening and closing the file.
- canreadfile functions: canreadfile1(filename, offset), canreadfile2(filename, offset),
  canreadfile3(filename, offset), canreadfile4(filename, offset),
  canreadfile(filename, offset, length) -
  basically the readfile() equivalents of canread1() etc.
- snestopc(address) and pctosnes(address) functions: for manually converting addresses (note
  that those functions are dependent on the ROM's current mapping mode, so use them with
  caution - chances are you will never need them at all).
- max(a, b), min(a, b) and clamp(value, min, max) functions: max()/min() return the
  maximum/minimum of two values, whereas clamp() makes sure that that value is >= min and
  <= max.
- safediv(dividend, divisor, exception) function: divides dividend by divisor, unless divisor
  is 0, in which case exception is returned.
- select(statement, true, false) function: if statement is 0, false is returned, in any other
  case, true is returned. Basically, a mathematical version of "if/else". Please note that
  unlike if/else blocks, function arguments in Asar are always evaluated before a function
  returns. In other words: if you do select(1, 1/1, 1/0), Asar will throw a "division by zero"
  error, even though the function would return 1/1. In this particular case, it's recommended
  to simply use the safediv() function in place of a regular division.
- not(value) function: returns 1 if value is 0 and 0 in any other case.
- comparison functions: equal(a, b), notequal(a, b), less(a, b), lessequal(a, b), greater(a, b),
  greaterequal(a, b) -
  rather self-explanatory, return 1 if the respective comparison is true and 0 otherwise.
  Primarily intended to be passed as statement to select() function.
- logical functions: and(a, b), or(a, b), nand(a, b), nor(a, b), xor(a, b) -
  also self-explanatory, return 1 if the respective logical operation is true and 0 otherwise.
  Primarily intended to be passed as statement to select() function.
- while loops: Added compile-time while loops to Asar. Those work similar to if conditionals,
  with the difference that their blocks are assembled repeatedly until their condition becomes
  false. For easier implementation and higher compatibility, while loops are terminated with
  endifs, just like if conditionals. When using while loops, be careful not to cause an
  infinite loop. Asar won't make any effort to detect those.
- Multiline operator: You can now put "\" at the end of any line of source code and Asar will
  append the next line to it. This is similar to putting a "," at the end of a line, with the
  difference, that the "\" itself does not appear in the concatenated string, whereas the ","
  would. This is useful to split long function definitions into multiplie lines, for example.
  Note that all whitespace following the \ is ignored, whereas whitespace preceeding the \
  isn't. Therefore  
      db\
 	  $FF 	   
  turns into  
      db$FF 	
  for example, whereas  
      db \
 	  $FF 	   
  turns into  
      db $FF 	
- double(num) print function: Can be passed to print to print a double variable with its
  fractional part. Has a default precision of 5 decimal places, but can be passed an optional
  second argument to override the precision.
- round(num, precision) function: Rounds the double variable "num" to "precision" decimal
  places. Pass 0 as precision to round to the nearest integer.

Bug fixes:
- Asar 1.37 officially suppported overloaded versions of read1() to read4(), but always threw
  "Wrong number of parameters to function" errors when actually using those overloaded versions.
- Asar 1.37 threw "Wrong number of parameters to function" error for function canread() when
  passing 2 arguments to it, because it actually treated it as canread1() due to an internal
  error in string comparison.
- Using better double -> int conversions in some places - where "dd $FFFFFFFF" would assemble
  to "00 00 00 80" ($80000000) in Asar 1.37, it now assembles to "FF FF FF FF"
- Defines in elseif conditionals now get properly resolved.
- The #= define operator now doesn't truncate its value when using "math round off", making
  it possible to do double-precision math with it.
- Asar 1.37 detected misplaced elses and endifs, but not misplaced elseifs.
- Putting "@xkas : @asar 1.37" on the first line would previously lead to an error, whereas
  putting "@asar 1.37 : @xkas" there would not. Both variations lead to an error message
  now, since it really doesn't make much sense to use them together in any combination.
- Special commands like @asar or @include could previously be used on the first line only
  and needed to be chained with a : inbetween. They can now be used on any line as long as
  no other command comes before or inbetween them.
- Asar 1.37 fixed a bug in SuperFX compilation, but src/test/arch-superfx.asm was never
  edited to acknowledge this fix, so the test always failed
- Added different define operators (=, +=, :=, #=, ?=) to manual.txt. Those have been in
  Asar for quite a while, but were never documented yet, although they can be quite useful.

Notes:
- This version of Asar was built in MSVC rather than g++, mainly because I already had that
  installed and use Visual Studo as an IDE, anyways. Functionally, this shouldn't make any
  difference, unless using Asar in unintended ways, where anything goes. I did build the
  Linux version in g++ to confirm compatibility, though.
  


v1.37 (by Raidenthequick):

New features:
- New freespace argument added; a $xx byte that will search the ROM for contiguous sections
  of that byte. Before it was hardcoded to only search for $00. Default is still $00 if
  not supplied, so past patches should not be broken.
- In line with this, autoclean was hardcoded to clean using $00. This was fixed also to clean
  with the byte supplied by freecode, or $00 if not supplied.
  
Bug fixes:
- Super FX short addressing fixed, and added error checking for valid short address.
  For example, lms r0,($00D4) used to output 3D A0 D4, which is actually incorrect
  because short addressing doubles the byte supplied by the instruction to give a range from
  $0000-$01FE with just one byte (since Super FX reads words). This now outputs
  3D A0 6A which is correct. Also, asar now throws an error for anything outside $0000-$01FE
  as well as all odd-numbered addresses for both sms and lms instructions. (Odd-numbered
  addresses cannot be accessed using short addressing due to the multiplying by 2.)
- Super FX and SPC700 labels were broken if used within freespace. This has been fixed by
  doing what 65816 does: mask the address with 0xFFFFFF because freespace addresses use
  a high byte to indicate that they're freespace.
- Fixed SA-1 mapping using wrong Super MMC banks range.
