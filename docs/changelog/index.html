			<li>p4plus2</li>
			<li>CypherSignal</li>
			<li>LDAsuku</li>
			<li>Katrina</li>
			<li>Atari2.0</li>
			<li>Vitor Vilela</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The C DLL binding for Windows should now print a few more details if loading the DLL failed. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>The <code>print</code> command has a new <code>bin()</code> function. Also, <code>bin()</code>, <code>dec()</code> and <code>hex()</code> now take an optional width argument that allows padding the number with zeroes. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Labels can now be used in the condition of an <code>assert</code> command. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>The WLA symbol file now includes an address-to-line mapping, which can be used by some debuggers to provide source-level debugging. (CypherSignal)</li>
			<li>The <code>sizeof()</code> and <code>objectsize()</code> functions don't need quotes around the struct name anymore. For backwards compatibilty, quotes are still allowed. (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>There is a new label optimizer, which can convert RAM labels to direct page or word accesses where possible. For this there are 3 new commands: <code>dpbase</code>, <code>optimize dp</code> and <code>optimize address</code>. (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>The <code>floor()</code> and <code>ceil()</code> functions have been added. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>The <code>bank()</code> and <code>&lt;:</code> function and math operator have been added (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>The <code>datasize()</code> function has been added. (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Warning if the mapper mode is changed after being set (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Major improvements to internal string handling in asar (makes asar significantly faster) (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Variadic macro support (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Support for global labels (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Errors about crossing banks have been improved, now they print the exact line where the bank border was crossed instead of saying it was "somewhere before this point". (randomdude999)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Asar DLL can now be loaded in Windows applications that define UNICODE. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Labels can now start with underscores. (LDAsuku)</li>
			<li>An <code>undef</code> command inside an unexecuted <code>if</code> statement would still get executed. This is now fixed. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>The <code>assert</code> command would give strange errors when the condition to test contained a comma. This is now fixed. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Trailing commas can now be used to join lines that contain more than one comma, and the joined lines can now have comments. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>An invalid warning ID in a <code>warnings enable</code> command no longer prints the error message three times. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>When using the Asar DLL, built-in defines (e.g. <code>!assembler_ver</code>) are now always present. Previously they were missing when the DLL was called without specifying a standard defines file. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Repeatable instructions (like <code>LSR #4</code> don't accept labels in their argument anymore. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Asar no longer writes an incorrect checksum for ROMs whose size isn't a power of 2, e.g. 2.5MB, 3MB, 6MB. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>The "It would be wise to set the 008000 bit" warning has been relaxed and isn't thrown for labels in banks 70-7F. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Overwriting built-in functions now throws a warning. Overwriting user-defined functions now also throws a warning for consistency. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Opcode length specifications were sometimes being ignored in <code>arch spc700</code>. Now <code>adc.w a, $0</code> properly assembles to <code>85 00 00</code> instead of <code>84 00</code>. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed case sensitivity problem in function calls. (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Fixed struct definition with label base corrupting label name. (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Fixed missing error on certain types of label. (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Fix some phantom errors in math processor (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed a memory leak in the cli version of asar (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Fixed a memory corruption in spc700 processing (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Fixed various memory bugs (found via valgrind/fsanitize) (p4plus2)</li>
			<li>Fixed a case where if statements wouldn't always throw an error (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed a case where you could get invisible errors when prefixing commands with <code>@</code> (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed <code>arch superfx</code> ignoring all commands with more than 2 words (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed non-ASCII characters in strings being written as garbage (Katrina)</li>
			<li>Fixed crashes when getting into an infinite recursion loop (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Improvements to syntax highlighting in the Asar manual (Atari2.0)</li>
			<li>The C# wrapper has been updated to work with Asar versions 1.60 and newer. (Vitor Vilela)</li>
			<li>Improved error message for SPC instructions with out of range arguments (randomdude999)</li>

		<div><h2>v1.71</h2>
		<b>Release:</b> January 6, 2019

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul><li>randomdude999</li></ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Super FX ROM mapping should now properly support freespace.</li>
			<li>The <code>canread()</code> functions returned true for the first byte after the end of the ROM. That has been fixed.</li>
			<li>Using <code>check bankcross off</code> now should mess with the PC less (i.e. no forced fastrom addressing).</li>
			<li>Using the <code>error</code> command now doesn't print the line of code that caused the error. All warnings except for the one from the <code>warn</code> command should now print the line of code that caused the warning. (note that not all warnings or errors are associated with a specific line of code.)</li>
		</ul></div>

		<hr />

		<div><h2>v1.70</h2>
		<b>Release:</b> January 4, 2019

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>randomdude999</li>
			<li>boldowa</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The <code>fullsa1rom</code> mapper now supports automatic freespace searching. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li><code>incbin</code> ranges can now use math as an alternative to unprefixed hex. To use this, surround the math with parentheses. For example, <code>incbin file:(4+2)-($F+$10)</code>. Note that in math statements, unprefixed numbers are decimal, not hex! (randomdude999)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed quite a few crashes in Asar: <ul>
				<li>Fixed a crash when including a directory (randomdude999, found by <a href="http://smwc.me/u/x10A94">Selicre</a>)</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when using a macro sublabel outside of a macro (randomdude999)</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when having unmatched structs in a weird way (randomdude999)</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when appending to a non-existent define (randomdude999, found by Selicre)</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when Asar encountered mismatched quotes after define evaluation (randomdude999, found by Alcaro)</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li>Made Asar about 2x faster than before (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Values larger than $80000000 in things like <code>dd</code> should work better (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed a freespace leak when using <code>prot</code> (randomdude999, found by WhiteYoshiEgg)</li>
			<li>Fixed Windows header includes, to make cross-compilation of Asar on Linux work better (boldowa)</li>
		</ul></div>
		
		<hr />

		<div><h2>v1.61</h2>
		<b>Release:</b> August 22, 2018

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>randomdude999</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed asar quietly skipping assembling a line if it had a label followed by 3 or more spaces and ended with <code>"</code>.</li>
			<li>In 1.60, <code>if !condition</code> was removed without a proper deprecation process. It has been re-added with a deprecation warning, because a few patches still managed to use it.</li>
		</ul></div>

		<div><h2>v1.60</h2>
		
		<b>Release:</b> July 6, 2018

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>RPG Hacker</li>
			<li>boldowa/6646</li>
			<li>zetaPRIME</li>
			<li>Horrowind</li>
			<li>randomdude999</li>

			<li>BenJuan26</li>
			<li>Vitor Vilela</li>
			<li>KevinCathcart</li>
			<li>KungFuFurby</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Asar is now officially hosted on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar">https://github.com/RPGHacker/asar</a></li>
			<li>Asar now uses CMake, which should make it easier to build on different platforms and with different compilers. (RPG Hacker, randomdude999, boldowa)</li>
			<li>Added a proper manual in HTML format to Asar, rather than just having the xkas manual and a TXT file with all changes. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added Python binding for the Asar DLL. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Added <code class="65c816_asar">defined()</code> function (randomdude999) and <code class="65c816_asar">undef</code> command. (zetaPRIME)</li>
			<li>Added simple syntax highlighting for Sublime Text. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>+/- label declarations can also end with an optional <code>:</code> now for consistency. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added macro-local variations for +/- labels and sub labels, which are also prefixed with a <code>?</code>. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added macro main label assignment. (RPG Hacker)
			<pre><code class="65c816_asar">macro my_macro()
	?MacroLabel = $008000
	
	dl ?MacroLabel	; Valid
endmacro

%my_macro()

dl ?MacroLabel		; Error!</code></pre></li>
			<li>Added support for a new type of label declaration: prefixing a label or sub label declaration (including macro labels) with <code>#</code> will create that label without modifying existing label hierarchies. This is mainly intended for hacky incsrc/routine macros as used by GPS, which can break existing label hierarchies when used. (RPG Hacker)
			<pre><code class="65c816_asar">macro my_new_routine()
	jsl MyNewRoutine
			
	!macro_routine_defined ?= 0
	
	if !macro_routine_defined == 0
		pushpc
		
		freecode cleaned
		
		#MyNewRoutine:
			incsrc routines/mynewroutine.asm
		
		pullpc
	
		!macro_routine_defined = 1
	endif
endmacro

Main:
	%my_new_routine()
.Sub

	; Both of these are found
	dl MyNewRoutine
	dl Main_Sub</code></pre>
			Note that while it's technically possible to use this feature on sub labels, macro labels and macro sub labels, I don't think there's any reasonable use case for this. In most cases, regular macro labels and regular macro sub labels are recommended for usage inside macros.
			</li>
			<li>Added support for include search paths. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added asar_patch_ex() function to DLL API, which works like asar_patch(), but takes additional parameters. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>You can now escape <code>!</code> by doing <code>\!</code> (useful for preventing Asar to replace defines in certain places). (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>You can now escape <code>\</code> by doing <code>\\</code>. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added support for <code class="65c816_asar">pushbase</code>/<code class="65c816_asar">pullbase</code>. (randomdude999, RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added <code class="65c816_asar">check title</code> command which makes Asar verify the title of the output ROM (to assure a patch is applied to the correct ROM). (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Added support for nested namespaces. (randomdude999, RPG Hacker)<br/>
				Enable them via the command:
				<pre><code class="65c816_asar">namespace nested on</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>Added support for <code class="65c816_asar">check bankcross off</code> which disables checking for bank crossing. Use with caution; might not work with certain features or outright break some stuff. (randomdude999, RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added a new, simple README. (randomdude999, RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added a <code class="65c816_asar">filesize()</code> function and a <code class="65c816_asar">getfilestatus()</code> function. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Added support for <code>stdincludes.txt</code> and <code>stddefines.txt</code> - see manual for details. (RPG Hacker, randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Added support for setting defines via the command line or DLL API. See manual (section: usage) for details. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Added <code class="65c816_asar">includeonce</code> command for shared files which may be included multiple times, but should only be assembled once. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added support for generating a symbols file. Currently, WLA and no$sns format are supported. (KevinCathcart)</li>
			<li>Opcode length specifiers (<code>.b</code>, <code>.w</code> and <code>.l</code>) are now also supported for the SPC700 architecture. (KungFuFurby)</li>
			<li>Added <code class="65c816_asar">stringsequal()</code> and <code class="65c816_asar">stringsequalnocase()</code> functions. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added support for some built-in defines. Currently, <code class="65c816_asar">!assembler</code> and <code class="65c816_asar">!assembler_ver</code> are supported. Trying to modify those defines will throw an error. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added IDs to all warnings and errors, together with functionality to enable or disable specific warnings. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Added a new optional warning that has to be enabled manually to throw warnings when opcodes are implicitly sized. (KevinCathcart)</li>
			<li>Added functionality to allow overriding Asar's default behavior of enabling/disabling checksum generation based on context. (randomdude999)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed various bugs in the DLL interface. It should now hopefully be possible to apply multiple patches in succession via the DLL interface without resorting to hacks. (RPG Hacker, randomdude999, boldowa)</li>
			<li>Rewrote big parts of test applications once again to make it a lot easier to test a bunch of ASM files and actually get some meaningful information out of it. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Fixed the way <code>;@</code> works. This command was really meant for backwards-compatibility with xkas and is supposed to assemble everything following it, which it now does again. (RPG Hacker)<br/>
			As a result of this change, any of the following are now valid Asar code:
			<pre><code class="65c816_asar">;@asar 1.60
@asar 1.60
asar 1.60</code></pre>
			When Asar finds an unknown command on a line starting with <code>;@</code> or <code>@</code>, it only throws a warning instead of an error. You can make use of this fact by using optional features from newer Asar versions and still have your patch assemble in old Asar versions, where those features are ignored (don't know how practicable and useful this really is, but in theory, it should be possible). And of course it can be used for patches that are compatible with both xkas and Asar, not that that's particularly useful anymore in this day and age.</li>
			<li>Changed format of existing command line arguments for consistency. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>LoROM banks <code>$70</code> to <code>$7D</code> can be used correctly. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Struct definitions are cleared correctly in Asar lib. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed a freeze that could occur when using <code class="65c816_asar">freedata align</code>. (TheBiob)</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug in <code class="65c816_asar">pad</code> command that made it not update the pc correctly and also made it trigger a bank cross error before actually writing any data into a new bank. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>Fixed a rare crash when using the command-line interface in ways you're not supposed to use it. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed <code class="65c816_asar">readfile()</code>/<code class="65c816_asar">canreadfile()</code> crashing when reading from more than 16 different files in the same patch. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed the ROM title being reported incorrectly. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed using really large values in math with <code>math round on</code> making the values negative sometimes. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed an SA-1 mapping issue. (Vitor Vilela, randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Fixed <code>print double()</code> not working when any of their arguments contain commas or parentheses. (randomdude999)</li>
			<li>Made it possible to pass string parameters to functions like <code class="65c816_asar">readfile1()</code> via user-defined functions. Previously, this failed as Asar expected all parameters in user-defined functions to be numbers. (KevinCathcart)</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug related to evaluation of parameters in user-defined functions. In some situations, Asar returned the incorrect parameter. For example: given a user-defined function with a parameter <code>ab</code> and a paramater <code>abc</code>, Asar occasionally returned the parameter <code>abc</code> when referencing the paramter <code>ab</code>. (KevinCathcart)</li>
			<li>Added more undocumented features to the manual. (RPG Hacker)</li>
			<li>0x hex literals were supported by Asar on some platforms, which wasn't supposed to be the case. Made sure 0x hex literals throw errors on all platforms. (randomdude999)</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Deprecated features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Started the process of deprecating xkas compatibility mode. From now on, using xkas compatibility features will throw warnings. In a future version of Asar, xkas compatibility will be removed entirely.</li>
			<li>Started deprecating <code class="65c816_asar">autoclear</code>, which is an alias of <code class="65c816_asar">autoclean</code>. Please use only <code class="65c816_asar">autoclean</code> from now on.</li>
			<li>Started deprecating <code class="65c816_asar">freespace fixed</code>, which is an alias of <code class="65c816_asar">freespace static</code>. Please use only <code class="65c816_asar">freespace static</code> from now on.</li>
			<li>Deprecated and removed support for <code class="65c816_asar">if !condition</code>. This feature was planned for deprecation as it bites with Asar's define syntax, but it was removed earlier than planned because, after inspecting the code, it was determined that it didn't work properly and probably wasn't even usable in versions prior to 1.60 at all. The only way to use it in Asar 1.60 was by using the new escape sequence for !, which didn't exist in earlier Asar versions. Thus it can be assumed that the feature wasn't used in previous Asar versions and can be removed safely. To negate conditions in Asar 1.60, either use the built-in logic functions (<code class="65c816_asar">if !(a == 0 && b == 0)</code> becomes <code class="65c816_asar">if not(and(equal(a, 0),equal(b, 0)))</code>) or directly negate the condition (<code class="65c816_asar">if !(a == 0 && b == 0)</code> becomes <code class="65c816_asar">if a != 0 || b != 0</code>).</li>

		<div><h2>v1.50</h2>
		
		<b>Release:</b> February 28, 2017

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>RPG Hacker</li>
			<li>p4plus2</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Added support for structs.</li>
			<li>Added API to Asar lib for getting information on all blocks of data written by Asar.</li>
			<li>Added API to Asar lib for getting the mapper currently used by Asar.</li>
			<li>Added support for ExLoROM and ExHiROM mappers.<br/>
				NOTE: Based entirely on conversion tables I got from Ladida; don't know if these conversions are actually correct. Some features may not work as intended when using those mappers (such as <code class="65c816_asar">freedata</code>, for example), but I can't verify this.</li>
			<li>Added <code class="65c816_asar">pushtable</code> and <code class="65c816_asar">pulltable</code> commands, which let you back-up or restore the current character table to the/from the stack.</li>
			<li>Added <code>ext\notepad-plus-plus\syntax-highlighting.xml</code>. This file can be imported into Notepad++ as a user-defined language to add syntax highlighting for Asar patches, featuring all commands currently supported by Asar. By default, this syntax highlighting is enabled on all files with an extension of <code>.asm</code> or <code>.asr</code>, but this can be customized via Notepad++.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Lines starting with <code>@</code> or <code>;@</code> that don't map to a recognized special command now only throw warnings at best and no errors.</li>
			<li>Rewrote code of tests a little to make them easier to execute and make them clean up their own mess.</li>
			<li>C# wrapper for Asar DLL was non-functional since it didn't specify a calling convention, making it always lead to an exception in some scenarios.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Just like the last version, this version of Asar was built in MSVC rather than g++, but this time I also updated the Asar DLL (which I had overlooked last time). I'm not sure if Windows applications are compatible with DLLs that were built by a different compiler, so if you're planning to use the DLL, this is something to watch out for. If you're planning to use a compiler other than MSVC, I recommend just rebuilding the DLL from source in whatever compiler you're using (or directly including the Asar library code in your project).</li>

		<div><h2>v1.40</h2>
		
		<b>Release:</b> October 23, 2016

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>RPG Hacker</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><code>readfile</code> functions: <code class="65c816_asar">readfile1(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">readfile2(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">readfile3(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">readfile4(filename, offset)</code> - similiar to <code class="65c816_asar">read1()</code> etc. functions, except data is read from another file instead of from the ROM (note that offset is a PC offset, not a SNES offset). You can pass an optional third value which is returned if the read fails. These functions are primarily intended for reading bytes from another file and then doing math with them. For example: reading bytes from a Lunar Magic .pal file, converting them into a different format and then writing them to the ROM as a table that can directly be DMA'd to CGRAM without further conversions (all conversions happen at compile-time). As an additional bonus, all of those functions cache any file passed to them (up to 16 simultanous files), which means that multiple readfile() calls on the same file will keep the file open rather than repeatedly opening and closing the file.</li>
			<li><code>canreadfile</code> functions: <code class="65c816_asar">canreadfile1(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">canreadfile2(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">canreadfile3(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">canreadfile4(filename, offset)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">canreadfile(filename, offset, length)</code> - basically the <code class="65c816_asar">readfile()</code> equivalents of <code class="65c816_asar">canread1()</code> etc.</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">snestopc(address)</code> and <code class="65c816_asar">pctosnes(address)</code> functions: for manually converting addresses (note that those functions are dependent on the ROM's current mapping mode, so use them with caution - chances are you will never need them at all).</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">max(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">min(a, b)</code> and <code class="65c816_asar">clamp(value, min, max)</code> functions: <code class="65c816_asar">max()</code>/<code class="65c816_asar">min()</code> return the maximum/minimum of two values, whereas <code class="65c816_asar">clamp()</code> makes sure that that value is <code>&gt;= min</code> and <code>&lt;= max.</code></li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">safediv(dividend, divisor, exception)</code> function: divides <code>dividend</code> by <code>divisor</code>, unless <code>divisor</code> is 0, in which case <code>exception</code> is returned.</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">select(statement, true, false)</code> function: if <code>statement</code> is 0, <code>false</code> is returned, in any other case, <code>true</code> is returned. Basically, a mathematical version of "if/else". Please note that unlike if/else blocks, function arguments in Asar are always evaluated before a function returns. In other words: if you do <code class="65c816_asar">select(1, 1/1, 1/0)</code>, Asar will throw a &quot;division by zero&quot; error, even though the function would return 1/1. In this particular case, it's recommended to simply use the <code class="65c816_asar">safediv()</code> function in place of a regular division.</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">not(value)</code> function: returns 1 if <code>value</code> is 0 and 0 in any other case.</li>
			<li>comparison functions: <code class="65c816_asar">equal(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">notequal(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">less(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">lessequal(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">greater(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">greaterequal(a, b)</code> - rather self-explanatory, return 1 if the respective comparison is true and 0 otherwise. Primarily intended to be passed as statement to <code class="65c816_asar">select()</code> function.</li>
			<li>logical functions: <code class="65c816_asar">and(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">or(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">nand(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">nor(a, b)</code>, <code class="65c816_asar">xor(a, b)</code> - also self-explanatory, return 1 if the respective logical operation is true and 0 otherwise. Primarily intended to be passed as statement to <code class="65c816_asar">select()</code> function.</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">while</code> loops: Added compile-time <code class="65c816_asar">while</code> loops to Asar. Those work similar to if conditionals, with the difference that their blocks are assembled repeatedly until their condition becomes false. For easier implementation and higher compatibility, while loops are terminated with <code class="65c816_asar">endif</code>, just like <code class="65c816_asar">if</code> conditionals. When using while loops, be careful not to cause an infinite loop. Asar won't make any effort to detect those.</li>
			<li>Multiline operator: You can now put <code>\</code> at the end of any line of source code and Asar will append the next line to it. This is similar to putting a <code>,</code> at the end of a line, with the difference, that the <code>\</code> itself does not appear in the concatenated string, whereas the <code>,</code> would. This is useful to split long function definitions into multiplie lines, for example. Note that all whitespace following the <code>\</code> is ignored, whereas whitespace preceeding the <code>\</code> isn't. Therefore
				<pre><code class="65c816_asar">db\
$FF</code></pre>
  turns into
				<pre><code class="65c816_asar">db$FF</code></pre>
				for example, whereas
				<pre><code class="65c816_asar">db \
$FF</code></pre>
				turns into
				<pre><code class="65c816_asar">db $FF</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">double(num)</code> print function: Can be passed to print to print a double variable with its fractional part. Has a default precision of 5 decimal places, but can be passed an optional second argument to override the precision.</li>
			<li><code class="65c816_asar">round(num, precision)</code> function: Rounds the double variable <code>num</code> to <code>precision</code> decimal places. Pass 0 as precision to round to the nearest integer.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Asar 1.37 officially suppported overloaded versions of <code class="65c816_asar">read1()</code> to <code class="65c816_asar">read4()</code>, but always threw &quot;Wrong number of parameters to function&quot; errors when actually using those overloaded versions.</li>
			<li>Asar 1.37 threw &quot;Wrong number of parameters to function&quot; error for function <code class="65c816_asar">canread()</code> when passing 2 arguments to it, because it actually treated it as <code class="65c816_asar">canread1()</code> due to an internal error in string comparison.</li>
			<li>Using better double -&gt; int conversions in some places - where
			<pre><code class="65c816_asar">dd $FFFFFFFF</code></pre>
			would assemble to <code>00 00 00 80</code> (<code>$80000000</code>) in Asar 1.37, it now assembles to <code>FF FF FF FF</code></li>
			<li>Defines in <code class="65c816_asar">elseif</code> conditionals now get properly resolved.</li>
			<li>The <code>#=</code> define operator now doesn't truncate its value when using <code class="65c816_asar">math round off</code>, making it possible to do double-precision math with it.</li>
			<li>Asar 1.37 detected misplaced elses and endifs, but not misplaced elseifs.</li>
			<li>Putting <code class="65c816_asar">@xkas : @asar 1.37</code> on the first line would previously lead to an error, whereas putting <code class="65c816_asar">@asar 1.37 : @xkas</code> there would not. Both variations lead to an error message now, since it really doesn't make much sense to use them together in any combination.</li>
			<li>Special commands like <code class="65c816_asar">@asar</code> or <code class="65c816_asar">@include</code> could previously be used on the first line only and needed to be chained with a <code>:</code> inbetween. They can now be used on any line as long as no other command comes before or inbetween them.</li>
			<li>Asar 1.37 fixed a bug in SuperFX compilation, but <code>src/test/arch-superfx.asm</code> was never edited to acknowledge this fix, so the test always failed</li>
			<li>Added different define operators (<code>=</code>, <code>+=</code>, <code>:=</code>, <code>#=</code>, <code>?=</code>) to manual.txt. Those have been in Asar for quite a while, but were never documented yet, although they can be quite useful.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Notes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This version of Asar was built in MSVC rather than g++, mainly because I already had that installed and use Visual Studo as an IDE, anyways. Functionally, this shouldn't make any difference, unless using Asar in unintended ways, where anything goes. I did build the Linux version in g++ to confirm compatibility, though.</li>

		<div><h2>v1.37</h2>
		
		<b>Release:</b> April 30, 2016

		<h3>Contributors:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Raidenthequick</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>New features:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>New <code class="65c816_asar">freespace</code> argument added; a <code>$xx</code> byte that will search the ROM for contiguous sections of that byte. Before it was hardcoded to only search for <code>$00</code>. Default is still <code>$00</code> if not supplied, so past patches should not be broken.</li>
			<li>In line with this, <code class="65c816_asar">autoclean</code> was hardcoded to clean using <code>$00</code>. This was fixed also to clean with the byte supplied by freecode, or <code>$00</code> if not supplied.</li>
		</ul>
  
		<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Super FX short addressing fixed, and added error checking for valid short address. For example, <code class="65c816_asar">lms r0,($00D4)</code> used to output <code>3D A0 D4</code>, which is actually incorrect because short addressing doubles the byte supplied by the instruction to give a range from <code>$0000</code>-<code>$01FE</code> with just one byte (since Super FX reads words). This now outputs <code>3D A0 6A</code> which is correct. Also, asar now throws an error for anything outside <code>$0000</code>-<code>$01FE</code> as well as all odd-numbered addresses for both <code class="65c816_asar">sms</code> and <code class="65c816_asar">lms</code> instructions. (Odd-numbered addresses cannot be accessed using short addressing due to the multiplying by 2.)</li>
			<li>Super FX and SPC700 labels were broken if used within freespace. This has been fixed by doing what 65816 does: mask the address with <code>0xFFFFFF</code> because freespace addresses use a high byte to indicate that they're freespace.</li>
			<li>Fixed SA-1 mapping using wrong Super MMC banks range.</li>

			<b>Release:</b> October 22, 2012
	
			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Made incbin file.bin -> $123456 possible. This one can go as far as you want; it doesn't mind crossing banks nor exceeding the size of a RATS tag. It does, however, demand to know the SNES position in advance; you can't use labels here. (It also refuses to go outside the ROM)</li>
				<li>Added a sandbox mode that disables everything that loads external files. Only accessible by recompiling (-DSANDBOX) since it should only be useful for people who have compilers already.</li>
				<li>Added a way to make the process abort if it runs too long. Linux+recompile (-DTIMELIMIT=60) only.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Nuked some spurious warnings in incsrc/incbin if the base path contains backslashes.</li>
				<li>Made Asar a little more eager to detect bank crossings. Now those errors appear in the correct file.</li>
				<li>Made REP #$FFFF throw errors instead of repeating 65535 times.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bunch of weird code in the freespace finders.</li>
				<li>Made sure . does not count as a label.</li>
				<li>Fixed LDA Label,y in emulation mode. Asar tried using 24-bit addressing for that, but there is no such addressing mode.</li>
				<li>Another accuracy improvement in emulation mode.</li>
				<li>Detonated some more SPC700 inaccuracies and bugs.</li>
				<li>Made JMP ($1234)+($3412) assemble to JMP abs, not JMP (abs).</li>

			<div><h2>v1.32</h2>
			
			<b>Release:</b> October 8, 2012
	
			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Added @xkas, which will revert to maximum xkas compatibility mode and change the behaviour of a couple of commands (as well as throwing warnings on various Asar-only commands).</li>
				<li>Any line starting with ;@ will now be assembled. This is intended to be combined with the above one to create ;@xkas, which will send Asar into xkas mode while letting xkas ignore it, but you can also use ;@if 0 : org !Freespace : ;@endif : ;@freecode (except with the colons replaced with linebreaks).</li>
				<li>Replaced bank off with bank auto, and added bank noassume, which always uses long addressing if possible.</li>
				<li>Removed the @ trick for suppressing warnings. Its only legit use was telling Asar that a freespace is cleaned in a way it can't understand. freecode cleaned is the new way to say that.</li>
				<li>Whitespace, blank lines and comments are now allowed to exist before @asar, ;@xkas and @include/@includefrom.</li>
				<li>Added !define ?= value, which sets !define to value if !define is previously undefined.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Blocked \ in incsrc/bin because linux.</li>
				<li>Reworked prot a bit. You can now use multiple prot statements in the same freespace; Asar has always allowed cleaning them out anyways. The old implementation was rather hacky.</li>
				<li>Fixed build scripts a little. Some files didn't get included.</li>
				<li>Fixed the internal ROM size when expanding SA-1 ROMs.</li>
				<li>Killed some dead code.</li>
				<li>Made db 0x80 assemble properly with math round on (the default).</li>
				<li>Killed a phantom error on ALS A and a couple of similar constructions.</li>
				<li>Squished a possible moving labels error.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where the major version of Asar got compared backwards in @asar.</li>

			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Added SuperFX mapper and arch superfx.</li>

				<li>Attached test suite in the source zip, in case some other programmers are interested.</li>
				<li>Added @include and @includefrom, which throws errors if Asar is invoked directly on them.</li>
				<li>Added a -pause=&lt;action&gt; flag on the command line. Valid actions are "yes", "warn", "err", and "no" (default).</li>

				<li>Made readN()ing and writing to the same byte in ROM well defined (it gives the same value as it had in the input ROM).</li>
				<li>Made the size guesser a little smarter. It now assumes .b for LDA #$123456/65536.</li>
				<li>Killed a phantom error on the very rare code pattern db $80/(Label2-Label1) : Label1: : db 0 : Label2: and similar.</li>

			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>freecode/freedata have been expanded: They now take an optional parameter containing comma separated parameters on how to hand out the freespace. Valid parameters are ram, noram, and static. ram tells Asar that this code needs the RAM mirrors and puts the code in banks 10-3F; noram tells Asar that the code (or table) does not need the RAM mirrors, and therefore uses banks 40-6F if possible; static demands that the freespace does not move; if it grows, Asar throws an error. freespace has also been added; freecode is a shortcut to freespace ram.</li>
				<li>Added hirom support. It works just like in xkas: hirom : org $C00000 : JML Main. Also added norom, where the PC address is the same as the SNES address (not counting SMC headers); use this (and base) if you want to implement your own mapper (preferably in a macro).</li>
				<li>Simplified table code, and made it accept assigning stuff to the = character.</li>
				<li>LDY #Label>>16 (and LDA/LDX/etc) is now considered 8bit. This should reduce the need for explicit .b hints.</li>
				<li>Asar can now use the last byte of the ROM as freespace.</li>
				<li>Made the default value for untouched table bytes be more random to make errors in usage more obvious.</li>
				<li>Lowered the recursion limit a bit.</li>
				<li>You can now drop the extensions on both filenames, if you want to.</li>
				<li>Asar now tries to no longer parse defines inside if 0 blocks. Note that this doesn't help on single-line if statements; you'll need a multiline if.</li>
				<li>Added !def := val, which expands everything inside the value before setting it (making !a := a!a a perfectly safe operation).</li>
				<li>Added !def #= val, which expands the value into an integer and stores it into the define. !a #= 1+1 : L!a: is a valid operation.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Fixed fastrom again again again.</li>
				<li>Labels before the first org/freecode/etc are now considered to be at $008000, not $FFFFFFFF. (They're still considered invalid.)</li>
				<li>Some minor fixes in autoclean dl Label.</li>
				<li>Repaired the ** operator.</li>
				<li>Calling a function no longer hits a user-defined function starting with the name of called function.</li>
				<li>Fixed skip command, which previously only edited the base address.</li>

			<h3>Contributors:</h3>

			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Made asardll.h and asardll.cpp work if compiled as both C and C++, and renamed asardll.cpp to asardll.c, for greater compatibility with other languages (hi, Objective-C). As an effect of this, the library name argument has disappeared from asar_init.</li>
				<li>base off is now a valid operation. It tosses the base address back to the current code insertion location.</li>
				<li>New command: bank. It makes the label optimizer act as if it's in another bank. This is not the same as base; LDA Label,x : Label: db $01,$02,$03,$04 will use 24-bit addressing for the LDA if bank is active. It's intended for long codes that assume the data bank register is not the same as the code bank register.</li>
				<li>Added a copy of GPLv3 to asar.zip, since LGPL is apparently meaningless on its own. These licenses are starting to get a little tricky.</li>

			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>

			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>New command: warn.</li>
				<li>The math parser now accepts strings like 0.5 if you turn off rounding. It'll break if rounding is on, since that wouldn't make any sense. It'll round down as soon as it's returned from the math parser; db 0.9 is the same as db 0, but db 0.4*0.4 is the same as db 1.</li>
				<li>assert can now take another parameter. If this is given, it is printed in the error message. (All error-generating blocks are printed, which makes these messages appear twice)</li>
				<li>Asar now attempts to check if the ROM title looks sane before applying a patch.</li>
				<li>Added Linux/OSX support to asardll.cpp.</li>
				<li>Added asar_math() to the library frontend.</li>
				<li>Now prints a message if patching is successful. However, calling it from the command line makes it remain silent, unless you add -verbose.</li>

			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>if statements have been made much more powerful. The old action if the statement is false was skipping the rest of the line if the statement is false; the new action is skipping the rest of the line, or if the if statement is at the end of the line, it skips everything until an endif. Nested if statements are allowed, as are else statements. (Note that you can't use else on one-line if statements.)</li>
				<li>New command: prot. If used directly after a freecode or freedata command (that is, at the start of the RATS tag), it may contain a list of labels (up to 80 or something). The freespace blocks pointed to by these labels are removed if the freespace area is cleared by an autoclean. Example: org $008000 : autoclean JSL Main : freecode : prot Mydata : Main: LDA Mydata : RTL : freedata : Mydata: db $12,$34,$56,$78</li>
				<li>Labels may be defined as Main(), not just Main:. This has been noted in the documentation.</li>
				<li>Asar can now be built as a DLL file, but it's not tested very throughly.</li>
				<li>'x' = $1234 is now a valid operation. It's equivalent to table file, but it accepts math and it's one file less to keep track of.</li>
				<li>db 'x'+4 is now a valid operation.</li>
				<li>freecode and freedata can now expand the ROM if needed.</li>
				<li>!a = abc : !{a}def is now valid operation; it's equivalent to abcdef. You can nest defines inside the !{}s; a!{b!{c!def}g}h is accepted (assuming all defines exist).</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>autoclean now works if called from $008000.</li>
				<li>autoclean now works if aiming for the last eight bytes of a RATS tag.</li>
				<li>autoclean now refuses to protect anything that isn't a label, for example math or constants, unless using the two-parameter method.</li>
				<li>autoclean now refuses to protect a label at the end of a freespace block, since it'll think the RATS tag after that is the one that should be removed.</li>
				<li>db 1/Label : Label: is now accepted, instead of being treated as a division by zero.</li>
				<li>($12),x is an error in xkas, since that addressing mode doesn't exist. However, Asar accepts parentheses and treats it as LDA $12,x, which isn't what the user meant. Therefore, it now emits a warning if this happens.</li>

			<b>Release:</b> October 18, 2011
	
			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Asar can now assemble SPC700 code, though very little testing was done on this and a lot of bugs may still be included. Also note that mov a,(x)+ has been moved to mov a,(x+), since that opcode increases X and not the value X points to. Two lines in arch-spc700.cpp can be uncommented to reenable the first syntax.</li>
				<li>The fastrom command has been moved to set fastrom on.</li>
				<li>Readded the base command.</li>
				<li>Other small changes.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The first line of stdlib is no longer ignored (a variable wasn't initialized).</li>
				<li>Assembling is aborted if errors are detected, instead of continuing. As a side effect from this, errors are no longer printed twice or thrice.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Deprecated features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>rep Label has been blocked. It was never supposed to be allowed.</li>
			</ul></div>

			<b>Release:</b> October 11, 2011
	
			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>LDA $9E,y is now treated as LDA $009E,y, but it prints a warning.</li>
				<li>New command: set. It can set various options, including expected ROM title (the romtitle command has been removed), if the .l->.w optimizer should be active, and if warnings should be shown.</li>
				<li>Asar can now automatically (try to) add colons where it thinks they should be. Note that this is disabled by default and not recommended for anything serious.</li>
				<li>As with the colon adder, it should be avoided unless there is a good reason to use it (for example running it from an IRC bot). (Note that a time limit should be enabled when running it from an IRC bot so that noone can freeze the bot with slow patches).</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Unknown command errors have been made saner. The old method was some sort of debug code.</li>
				<li>Carriage returns are now ignored on Linux.</li>
				<li>Assembling blank patches on nonexistent ROMs or ROMs with length zero has been fixed.</li>
			</ul></div>

			<b>Release:</b> October 9, 2011
	
			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>!a += +1 has been implemented. </li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Bug fixes:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>If you type "freespace", the tool gives a more detailed error message that "Unknown command."</li>
				<li>A bug related to using pushpc inside a freespace has been fixed.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>Notes</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>The tool has been renamed to Asar. Pronounciation: The first A is short, and the second is long (as in "Bazaar", except without the B). It doesn't matter if the S is pronounced as S or Z.</li>

			<h3>Contributors:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Alcaro</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>It now looks for and assembles stdlib.asm. However, it prints an error if it doesn't find it.</li>
				<li>Expected ROM title can now be set, see stdlib.asm for details. It defaults to SUPER MARIOWORLD if omitted, and it may not be set outside of stdlib.asm.</li>
				<li>A 64-bit version has been included.</li>
				<li>Both autoclean and autoclear works now. They act identically.</li>

			</ul>
	
			<h3>New features:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Parentheses can be used, which allows some previously impossible statements.</li>

				<li>An if statement has been included, to get rid of the need for including those rep -1 tricks.</li>
				<li>Freespace can be set automatically (it even includes a simple way to reclaim freespace used by older versions of the patch)</li>
