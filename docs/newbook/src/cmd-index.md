# List of commands

This is a list of all commands Asar supports, linking to the manual chapter explaining them. In addition to these, Asar accepts assembly instructions, the list of which depends on the currently active architecture ([65816](./arch-65816.md), [spc700](./arch-spc700.md), [superfx](./arch-superfx.md)).
