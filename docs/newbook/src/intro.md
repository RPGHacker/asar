# Asar

A multi-architecture SNES assembler originally written by _Alcaro_, modelled after **xkas v0.06** by _byuu_.

This manual was originally written by _RPG Hacker_ and has been extended by various contributors. If you find any issues, please report them on the GitHub repository.

As a general rule, the manual uses `{}` to denote required parameters and `[]` to denote optional parameters (where optional parameters ending in `...` mean "zero or more" of that parameter). Everything else refers to keywords/names.

You can view this entire book on one page by using the "print" button on the top right and canceling the print operation.
