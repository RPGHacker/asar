# Supported 65816 instructions

Due to legacy from xkas, Asar's `MVN` and `MVP` instructions are backwards from most other assemblers: the syntax is `MVN dest, src`. Also, a 16-bit argument like `MVN $ssdd` (where $ss is source, $dd is destination) is accepted too (edit: not in asar2 it isn't).

All other instructions use syntax recommended by WDC, with some additional liberties:
- for accumulator-addressed instructions (`inc a` etc), the `a` argument can be omitted.
- `cop`, `brk` and `wdm` are assembled as 2-byte instructions, with with the second byte being optional and defaulting to zero.


<!-- TODO: use nonzero arguments here and put the corresponding asm bytes next to them -->
